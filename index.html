    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <p><mark> Copyright &#169; by David Matuzsek</mark></p>
    <p><strong>Backtracking</strong> is a form of <em> recursion</em></p>
    <p>
      The usual scenurio is <ins>that</ins> you are <del>faced</del> with a
      number of options, and you must choose one of these. After you make our
      choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get
      depends on what choice you made. This procedure is repeated over and over
      until you reach a final state. If you make a good sequence of choices,
      your final state is goal state; if you didn't, it isn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree: the tree probably has some
      good leaves and somme bad leaves, though it may be that the leaves are all
      good or all bad, You want to get to a good leaf, At each node, beginning
      with the root,you chose one of its children to move to, and you keep this
      until you get up to a leaf.

    <ol>
      <li>Return success if the current point is a viable solution.</li>
      <li>
        otherwise, if all paths have been exhausted (i.e., the current point is
        an endpoint), return failure because there is no feasible solution.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the current point is not an endpoint, backtrack and explore other
        points, then repeat the preceding steps.
      </li>
    </ol>

      <li>
        It is used to solve a variety of problems. You can use it, for example,
        to find a feasible solution to a decision problem.
      </li>
      <li>
        Backtracking algorithms were also discovered to be very effective for
        solving optimization problems.
      </li>
      <li>
        In some cases, it is used to find all feasible solutions to the
        enumeration problem.
        <ol>
          <li>
            Backtracking, on the other hand, is not regarded as an optimal
            problem-solving technique.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is useful when the solution to a problem does not have a time
            limit.
          </li>
